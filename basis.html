<h1>Reflex basis and faculties</h1>

<p>There are two kinds of reflexes in Escher: 
<ul>
<li>Those that are implemented in the underlying technology, the Go language, and linked into the runtime, which we call
<em>basis</em> reflexes.
<li>And those that are compositions of other reflexes, described by program circuits, which we call 
<em>derivative reflexes</em>.
</ul>

<p>Basis reflexes determine the basic arithmetic and data manipulation 
operations that Escher programs can ultimately perform, as well as
external technologies that Escher programs might have access to.

<h3>Arithmetic</h3>

<p>There are various ways to design and implement small sets of
arithmetic basis reflexes that would render circuit programs Turing-complete.
We leave the design of such bases to the users of Escher, whose imagination
and use cases might inform choices that we cannot predict from scratch.

<h3>Information flow</h3>

<p>We find that most Escher programs benefit from
a few basic reflexes that control information flow. 
We have included a few in the default runtime and they are described in the following
sections. These gates can be viewed as Escher's “synchronization” facilities.

<h3>External technologies</h3>

<p>Basis reflexes are also Escher's way of interacting with external technologies,
such as input/output devices. The POSIX systems is a canonical example of an
external technology and Escher has a dedicated <code>os</code> faculty for it.

<h3>Escher within Escher</h3>

<p>The most powerful feature of Escher is its recursive nature: Circuit programs
can create program circuits and materialize them into other circuit programs.
This programming pattern is enabled by the <code>escher</code> faculty,
which among other things offers reflexes that materialize program circuits.
