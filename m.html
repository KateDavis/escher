<p>In addition to representing data, Escher circuits can represent executable code.

<p>Escher's syntax is intended to facilitate manual codification of small circuits
by a human operator. In typical use cases, like for instance the codification of
datacenter service topologies, the graphs to be described are huge. To facilitate
building such graphs, Escher provides a mechanism for building out large complex
graphs modularly and recursively from smaller circuits.

<p>This mechanism, called <em>materialization</em>, will also optionally convert
the nodes of the resulting circuits into running services, called <em>reflexes</em>,
interconnected according to the circuit design.

<h2 id="expanding">Expanding circuits</h2>

<p>Consider the following input circuit:

<pre class="escher">
Employees {
	Manager Eric
	Engineer Petar
	Project "XData"
	Manager:Supervises = Engineer:SupervisedBy
}
</pre>

<p>Here the gates <code>Engineer</code> and <code>Manager</code> have address values.
Suppose further that circuits named <code>Eric</code> and <code>Petar</code> are
defined within an enclosing circuit <code>Memory</code>:

<pre class="escher">
Memory {
	Eric {
		First "Eric"
		Last "Whyne"
	}
	Petar {
		First "Petar"
		Last "Maymounkov"
		Home Brooklyn
		First:Lives = Home:
	}
	Brooklyn {
		Address "Brooklyn, NY"
	}
}
</pre>

<p>Starting from the input circuit, we would like to expand every address gate value into its
respective definition from <code>Memory</code>, and do so <em>recursively</em> 
until no unexpanded addresses are left, to get:

<pre class="escher">
Employees {
	Manager {
		First "Eric"
		Last "Whyne"
	}
	Engineer {
		First "Petar"
		Last "Maymounkov"
		Home {
			Address "Brooklyn, NY"
		}
		First:Lives = Home:
	}
	Project "XData"
	Manager:Supervises = Engineer:SupervisedBy
}
</pre>

<p>Note that circuit links are merely copied during expansion.

<p>Escher's Go package <code>"github.com/gocircuit/escher/be"</code> provides
a function for performing the aforemention expansion:

<pre class="go">
func Materialize(memory Circuit, design Value) (reflex Reflex, residual Value)
</pre>

<p>Ignoring the returned value <code>reflex</code> for now,
the value of <code>residual</code> will equal the expanded circuit.
It is unlikely that Escher users will call this function directly, as we explain later on.
